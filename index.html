    <h3>About Scott</h3>
  <p>I have worked in healthcare for over a decade and am looking to start over with something brand new. I chose Software Engineering because I feel like it is a very expressive way to work and am excited to work with others on as many projects that I can!</p>
    <p>My skills and certifications include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drawing Blood</li>
      <li>BLS Certification</li>
      <li>Phlebotomy Certification</li>
    </ul>
  <p>I also enjoy playing music in my band, Seconds To Years, where I am the lead singer. As well as playing videogames with friends.</p>
